The UMIST Cropped Dataset consists of grayscale face images of multiple individuals. In this project, we preprocess the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), analyze clustering to group similar faces, and train models to classify the individuals effectively. Our team has used Keras based models to solve this problem.
